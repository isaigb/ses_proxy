# SES Proxy
The goal of this project was to develop a proxy measure for socioeconomic status using the Census' publicly available American Community Survey (ACS) data. A technical memo is currently in progress and will be linked to from here once it is completed and published online.

Because I currently work primarily with Stata users, the Stata code found here serves as ground truth for what I did for this project and will be the code that will remain with the research team moving forward. There is also an R script that downloads ACS data from the Census API.

## Organization
The Stata folder contains Stata code used to clean the data, generate PCA components, and measure the success of the proxy variable(s). The `0.0_data_cleaning_Control.do` runs the project from start to finish and calls in the appropriate do files when necessary.

The R folder houses the script that downloads the ACS 5-year estimates for 2015-2020.

TODO:
 - Add PCA regressions file
 - Add Python code for PCA

Python folder is currently a work in progress and will house Python code that downloads ACS data and generates the proxy variables generated by the Stata code. A more narrative Jupyter notebook will also be included that walks through the proxy construction using Python libraries.
